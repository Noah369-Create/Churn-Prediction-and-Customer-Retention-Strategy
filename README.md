# Churn-Prediction-and-Customer-Retention-Strategy
Customer churn refers to the proportion of subscribers who discontinue using a telecom company's services within a specific period. Predicting churn is a critical yet challenging task in the telecom industry, where the cost of customer acquisition (CAC) is high, and competition is fierce. For telecom operators, retaining existing customers is not only more cost-effective than acquiring new ones but also essential for maintaining market share and revenue stability. The ability to identify high-risk customers with precision, while there is still an opportunity to intervene, unlocks significant revenue potential. Leveraging predictive analytics in churn management empowers telecom companies to enhance customer satisfaction, implement targeted retention strategies, and maximize lifetime value.
